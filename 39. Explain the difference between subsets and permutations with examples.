ðŸ”¹1. Subsets:
A subset of a set is any collection of elements from the set, including the empty set and the set itself. The order of the elements in a subset doesn't matter, only the elements present do.

Key Points:
    Order doesn't matter in subsets.
    Duplicates are not allowed in a set, so subsets can only contain unique elements from the original set.
    The size of a subset can range from 0 (empty subset) to the size of the original set.
    The number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n.

Example:
Consider the set {1, 2, 3}.

  The subsets of {1, 2, 3} are:
     {}, [] (empty subset)
     {1}, {2}, {3}
     {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}
     {1, 2, 3} (the set itself)

Thus, the total number of subsets is 2^3 = 8.

ðŸ”¹2. Permutations:
A permutation of a set refers to a specific arrangement of all or some elements of the set. Unlike subsets, the order of the elements does matter in permutations. In other words, changing the order of the elements creates a different permutation.

Key Points:
    Order matters in permutations.
    Each element in the set is used exactly once (no repetition in a single permutation).
   If the set has n elements, the number of permutations of the set (arrangements) of size n is n! (n factorial).
   If the permutation is of a subset of size k, the number of permutations is calculated using the formula P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!.

Example:
Consider the set {1, 2, 3}.

  The permutations of {1, 2, 3} are:
      {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}

Thus, there are 3! = 6 permutations of the set {1, 2, 3}.
