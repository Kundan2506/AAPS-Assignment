🔹Equilibrium Index?
An equilibrium index in an array is an index i such that:

Sum of elements to the left of 𝑖=Sum of elements to the right of 𝑖

Example:
Input: A = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
Output: 3

Explanation:
Left sum = -7 + 1 + 5 = -1  
Right sum = -4 + 3 + 0 = -1  
So index 3 (value 2) is an equilibrium index.

🔹How to Find It?
Compute the total sum of the array.

Traverse the array while maintaining the left sum.

At each index i, check if leftSum == totalSum - leftSum - A[i].
