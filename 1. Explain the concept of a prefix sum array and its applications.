A prefix sum array is an array where each element at index i stores the sum of all elements from the original array from index 0 to i.

Example:
Given an array:

arr = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
The prefix sum array prefix will be:

prefix[0] = 2
prefix[1] = 2 + 4 = 6
prefix[2] = 6 + 1 = 7
prefix[3] = 7 + 3 = 10
prefix[4] = 10 + 5 = 15

=> prefix = [2, 6, 7, 10, 15]

Once you have the prefix sum array, you can quickly calculate the sum of elements in any subarray [l, r] in constant time:

Sum(l,r)=prefix[r]âˆ’prefix[lâˆ’1]
(Note: if l == 0, then the sum is just prefix[r])

ðŸ”¹ Applications of Prefix Sum Array
Efficient Range Sum Queries

Answer multiple queries like: "What is the sum from index i to j?" in O(1) time after an O(n) preprocessing.

Finding Equilibrium Index

An index where the sum of elements to the left equals the sum to the right.

Subarray Sum Problems

Used to find the number of subarrays with a given sum (k) using hash maps.

2D Prefix Sum (Matrix prefix sum)

Useful in image processing or matrix manipulation (e.g., fast computation of sum of elements in a submatrix).

Cumulative Frequency

In problems involving frequency/count (e.g., counting number of elements â‰¤ x in a range).
